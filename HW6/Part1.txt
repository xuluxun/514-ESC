1.

1)
P(catching a fish during a 10-minute attempt) = 20/100 = 0.2

2)
P(stopped raining|one or more fish were caught) = P(stopped raining^one or more fish were caught)/P(one or more fish were caught) 
= (5/100) / (20/100) = 0.25

3)
P(stopped raining|no fish were caught) = P(stopped raining^no fish were caught)/P(no fish were caught) 
= (2/100) / (80/100) = 0.025

4)
P(one fisherman catching one or more fish during a single 10-minute period|stopped raining)*P(stopped raining) = 
P(stopped raining|one fisherman catching one or more fish during a single 10-minute period)*P(one fisherman catching one or more fish during a single 10-minute period)
P(one fisherman catching one or more fish during a single 10-minute period|stopped raining)*(7/100) = 0.25*0.2
P(one fisherman catching one or more fish during a single 10-minute period|stopped raining) = 5/7

|F      |W            |Joint Probability|
|Fish   |Stop raining |1/20             |
|Fish   |Still raining|3/20             |
|No Fish|Stop raining |1/50             |
|No Fish|Still raining|39/50            |

6)
Marginal distribution of F = {1/5, 4/5}
Marginal distribution of W = {7/100, 93/100}
P(F) = 4/25
P(W) = 651/10000
F and W are not independent.
